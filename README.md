# Color Picker App

A lightweight, responsive web app that lets you pick colors, view their HEX, RGB, and HSL codes, copy them to your clipboard, and save your favorites for later. Built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with Tailwind CSS, this project demonstrates core front-end techniques: event handling, DOM manipulation, and the Web Storage API.

## Features

- 🎨 **Native Color Picker**  
  Choose any color using the browser’s built-in `<input type="color">`.
- 🖋️ **Real-time Code Display**  
  Automatically shows HEX, RGB, and HSL values as you pick.
- 📋 **Copy to Clipboard**  
  One-click buttons to copy each color code.
- 💾 **Save Favorites**  
  Store your favorite colors in `localStorage` and reload them on page load.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**  
  Mobile-first layout with Tailwind CSS utility classes.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for semantic structure
